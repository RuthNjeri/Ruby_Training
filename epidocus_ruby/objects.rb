# everything in Ruby is an object "hello" [1,2,3]
# to get the object type irb in the terminal then "hello.class()" =>string
# .class() is a method(function called on an object)
# all objects are instances of a class
# Interesting: 1+3 is passing an argument in a method and calling it on an object 1.+(3)
# Ruby has a lot of syntactic sugar.. syntax that is sweet to the human eye, easier to read or express
# Number Class and methods >5.even?() => false
# >5.round() => 5
# >6.4.ceil() =>7
# you can chain methods together when one method returns an object  > 6.9.round().next() => 8
